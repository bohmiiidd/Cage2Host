Containers are cages… until the kernel forgets the lock.
One syscall away from freedom — welcome to the host.
Jail broken: the kernel never saw it coming.
Behind every container, a kernel waits to be fooled.
Access granted, the shell is yours.
Escaping namespaces like a ghost in the machine.
Root is just a word until you take it.
Docker thinks it controls you… think again.
Every exploit starts with a curious mind.
Watch the kernel blink, then slip past.
